This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

1.i will choose microservices base architecture because react is an single thred language and it to one task at onece. but it is more good to done asynchronous works. and return its promises results at time. 
and its done event looping and do grate job. 

2.src/
	app/
		auth/
			login/page.tsx
			register/page.tsx
	shop/page.tsx
	products/[id]/page.tsx


3. it depends on what we needs to do.
if the requrements and other staff are clear then we can chouses SQL.
we can chose NoSQL for this and it is easy and its takes data as Json fomat. and we can use firebase or mongo for this.

4. for the font end use next.js 
its have better UI libraris and and most of them are free to use. so then we dont need to do start from the scratch. in my repo i also used one of that. shadcn so its easy to build and create next app. and there is also have templates too. 
we can use them if we needs to. 
and make better uis too.
because it have SSR and CSR and better SEO, and fasters landing pages(server side rendering pages).
and do asinc functions 


5.this is production grade software because of that we can chose AWS because its trending and its can scalability. security, and reliability. and also have pay as you go.i herd that react hosting also easy on that.

6. as we develop we can use front endoptimization in the beginning. using Serverside rendering pages more. and using auto scaling databases for the db.


I haven’t used React professionally because my recent work has been focused on a different tech stack called Marble(2.5 years but i have some projects do in my free time in react.i will add them as well in this ), which I’ve been specializing in. However, I am confident in my ability to quickly learn and adapt to React if the role requires it, as I have strong fundamentals in frontend development and experience with similar frameworks.
